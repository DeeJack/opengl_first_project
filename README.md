# OpenGL First Project
My first project with openGL, learning how to render 2d and 3d objects, load textures, play sounds etc. with openGL (glfw and glew).

I learned OpenGL with the youtube channel [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw), so I took ispiration from his code (in other words, there may be some similar/identical code in some parts). Other resources I used:
    - [OpenGL-Tutorial](https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/)
    - [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Transformations)

I made several tests to... test what I can do with OpenGL, and they can be selected by the menu created with ImGUI.
The dependencies are:
    - GLFW
    - GLEW
    - stbimage (image loading)
    - glm (math stuff)
    - irrKlang (audio)

The tests are created include:
    - Sorting algorithms visualization (for now insertion sort and bubble sort)
    - 2d and 3d rendering
    - Camera movement with mouse and keyboard
    - Texture loading
