# OpenGL First Project
My first project with openGL, learning how to render 2d and 3d objects, load textures, play sounds etc. with openGL (glfw and glew).<br>

I learned OpenGL with the youtube channel [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw), so I took ispiration from his code (in other words, there may be some similar/identical code in some parts). Other resources I used:<br>
    - [OpenGL-Tutorial](https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/)<br>
    - [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Transformations)<br>
<br>
I made several tests to... test what I can do with OpenGL, and they can be selected by the menu created with ImGUI.<br>
The dependencies are:<br>
    - GLFW<br>
    - GLEW<br>
    - stbimage (image loading)<br>
    - glm (math stuff)<br>
    - irrKlang (audio)<br>
<br>
The tests are created include:<br>
    - Sorting algorithms visualization (for now insertion sort and bubble sort)<br>
    - 2d and 3d rendering<br>
    - Camera movement with mouse and keyboard<br>
    - Texture loading<br>
<br>
